    "On p.22, it is mentioned that sorting algorithms (quicksort, bubble sort, merg sort, etc.) require a total order, i.e. all objects in the set have an order relation with each other and $a = b$ iff $a \\leq b$ and $b \\leq a$. The author also mentions that for partially ordered sets, there exists topological sorting algorithms: see for example [this website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-topological-sorting/)."

    "The article linked above also gives a great motivation as to the usefulness of monoids in Big Data: if the objects and morphisms you want to make use of in your calculation are a monoid category, it is easy to distribute the calculation and run it in parallel. Many calculations used in Big Data are clearly monoids, such as counting, finding a min/max, but also less simple calculations can be transformed into a monoid structure (mean, variance, skewness, ...)."
